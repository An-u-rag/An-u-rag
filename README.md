- 👋 Hi, I’m @An-u-rag aka Anurag Parcha. Currently working as a Machine Learning Developer at 3DM Devices Inc. Some of my main responsibilities are to integrate AI into the production pipeline for realtime anomaly detection in manufacturing lines for tires, software development in C++ for the production software and also continuously performing optimization for AI inference, training and testing production-ready computer vision models and developing productivity improvement and QoL tools for the software team. 

- 👨‍🎓 Recently graduated from the Masters of Professional Computer Science program from Simon Fraser University. Specializing in AI, Computer Vision and Graphics.

- 👀 I’m interested in Development, mainly development for a purpose or to solve a real world problem. My main area of focus is Artificial Intelligence i.e. Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Computer Graphics. I also love to think about how my areas of interest can translate to applying in Extended Reality which includes Augmented, Virtual, and Mixed reality environments. 
      
- 🌱 I am currently researching on Content-Aware Upsampling and Style Transfer for Point Clouds from prior Image-View Synthesis of Indoor and Outdoor Scenes. This problem has applications in autonomous driving, robotics and entertainment media such as for virtual environments utilized in movies and games.
- I worked on Synthetic data generation in NVIDIA Omniverse and Unreal Engine. The generated data was extracted in a format that can be used to train Neural Networks for various features such as Classification, Segmentation, Detection, Pose Estimation and more. 
- I worked on my Capstone Project which is a 3D computer graphics library in Elm Functional Programming Language for developing a frontend framework in Elm for handling complex mathematical transforms and functions related to 3D geometry and animations in a simplified manner. 
- I am also working on improving my Game Development skills in Unity3D and C#. 
- Improving my grasp on Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Computer Graphics through projects.

- Founded Cosmoteem 2020. You can check the website here https://cosmoteem.com. Still being worked and will be worked on in the future to include more features. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Computer Vision/Graphics, Extended Reality and Game Development research or projects.
