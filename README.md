- 👀 I’m interested in Development, mainly development for a purpose or to solve a real world problem. My main area of focus is in Computer graphics and     animation for the usage of Extended Reality which includes Augmented, Virtual, and Mixed reality environments. I also love to research and work in latest   technological fields which potray potential to bring about revolutionary changes such as blockchain, IoT, ML and AI.

- I’m worked on my Capstone Project which is a 3D computer graphics library in Elm Functional Programming Language for developing a frontend framework in     Elm for handling complex mathematical transforms and functions related to 3D geometry and animations in a simplified manner. 
- I am also working on improving my Game Development skills in Unity3D and C#. 
- Improving my grasp on Machine Learning and Artifical Intelligence through projects.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Game Development, Extended Reality (Web and App) and Computer Graphics/Vision projects.
